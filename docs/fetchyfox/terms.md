## Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to FetchyFox!  FetchyFox, Inc. owns and operates the website [www.fetchyfox.com](http://www.fetchyfox.com/) and a mobile application, as well as other websites, mobile or touch applications we have now or in the future, (collectively, the “Site”), which connects consumers, retail stores, service providers and restaurants, with FetchyFox staff to facilitate services including, but not limited, to on-demand delivery services (the “Services”).

Please read these Terms of Service (“Terms”) carefully. By using the Site or Services, you affirm that you have read and agree to comply with, and be legally bound by, each of the terms, conditions, and restrictions of these Terms.  Our Privacy Policy is at [www.FetchyFox.com/privacy,](http://www.fetchyfox.com/privacy,) and is incorporated by reference into these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, including our Privacy Policy, you have no right to obtain information from or otherwise continue using the Site or Services.

Individuals who use the Site are “Users”, and “you” and “your” refer to Users. If you access the Site or accept these Terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that legal entity and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer to that legal entity.  “We”, “us”, or “our” refer to FetchyFox. In addition, in these Terms, unless the context requires otherwise, words in one gender include all genders and words in the singular include the plural and vice-versa.

THE SERVICE IS AN ONLINE PLATFORM THROUGH WHICH YOU MAY MAKE PURCHASES FROM PRODUCT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS USING OUR SITE AND OUR STAFF. IN DOING SO, WE ARE ACTING AS YOUR AGENT AND WE ARE NOT THE SELLER OF ANY PRODUCT.  YOU AGREE THAT WE ARE YOUR AGENT, THAT THE SELLER REMAINS THE MERCHANT OF RECORD, AND THAT TITLE TO ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE PASSES FROM THE SELLER TO YOU AT THE TIME OF YOUR PURCHASE. FETCHYFOX IS NOT A PARTY TO ANY AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BETWEEN YOU AND A SELLER.

## Modification

FetchyFox reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Site, Services or to modify these Terms at any time and without prior notice. If we modify these Terms, we will post the modification on the Site. We will also update the “Last Updated Date” at the top of these Terms. Modifications to these Terms will automatically take effect upon posting; provided, however, that material changes to the Terms will be effective as to an existing User thirty (30) days after posting. By continuing to access or use the Site after we have posted a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease accessing or using the Site and Services.

## Eligibility

The Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older. By accessing or using the Services you represent and warrant that you are not legally prohibited from accessing the Services under the laws of the country in which you access or use them.

## About the Service; Registration

The Service allows Users to access information and services from services providers, retailers, and restaurants regarding products, place orders, make purchases, and arrange for delivery of purchased products or services.  To access and use the Services, you must register an account (“User Account”). We offer two ways to create an account - direct registration using an email address, or registration via third party social networking sites.

Direct Registration: To create a User Account by using your email address, follow the prompts on the Site.  You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during registration and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete. You agree that you will safeguard your password and that you are solely responsible for any activities or actions under your User Account, whether or not you have authorized such activities or actions. You will immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your User Account.  You are solely responsible for your Content (defined below) and User Account.

Registration via Third Party: You may also create a User Account via certain third party service provider’s  social networking site including, but not limited to, Facebook (each such account, a “Third Party Account”) by following the prompts on the Site.  You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to us and to grant us access to your Third Party Account to provide the Services without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating us to pay any fees or making us subject to any usage limitations imposed by such third party service providers.

By creating a User Account, you are agreeing to receive communications from us via email, text message, calls, and push notifications to the mobile telephone number you provide. You agree that you may receive communications generated by automatic telephone dialing systems and/or which will deliver prerecorded messages, communications regarding your orders, and promotional message from us, sellers that you purchase from, or third parties.  If you do not wish to receive promotional emails, text messages, or other communications, you may opt out of such communications at any time in your User Account settings. You may also opt-out of receiving text messages from us by replying "STOP” from the mobile device receiving the messages.

## Service Process; Fees

In consideration of the Services, we will assess you a fee on each purchase  (the “Service Fee”).  The Service Fee for any purchase will be shown to you during the check-out process.  Service Fees are non-refundable.

When you use the Service to purchase a product or service, we will share information with the product or service provider as necessary or requested.  At all times we are acting as your agent and not the seller of any product or service; the product or service provider remains the sole merchant of record, and title to any product or service passes from them to you at the time of your purchase.

We will also process information, including payments, through third party service providers.  In order to use the Services, you must provide account information for at least one valid credit or debit card.  You hereby authorize FetchyFox or its service provider to run card authorizations requests on all cards provided by you, to store card or other financial details as your method of payment for Services, and to charge your  card for your purchases and the Service Fee. For any recurring charges, such as a Subscription Fee if or when implemented, you authorize us or our third-party payment processor to bill your payment card in advance on a periodic basis.

You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from your device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto.

You will be required to provide valid government-issued identification proving your age to the person making your delivery, and you agree that you will not be intoxicated when receiving delivery of alcohol products.  We reserve the right to cancel the alcohol-related portion of any purchase in our sole discretion if we determine that any requirement of this section of these Terms is not met.

## Controlling Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the Dispute Resolution Provision below.

YOU AND FETCHYFOX AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR CONTENT MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED AND WAIVED.

## Severability

These Terms are intended to govern the agreement between FetchyFox and you to the extent permitted by all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall, for any reason or to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby, but rather shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law.

## Dispute Resolution Provision

You and FetchyFox agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, the Services or the Site (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration; except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.

You acknowledge and agree that you and FetchyFox are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and FetchyFox otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding.

Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org/](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.

Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org/](http://www.adr.org/) and a separate form for California residents at [www.adr.org/.](http://www.adr.org/) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and FetchyFox otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and FetchyFox submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.

Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $20,000, FetchyFox will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

No Class Action. YOU AND FETCHYFOX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

PAGA Waiver. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY LAW, THERE WILL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT, HEARD, OR ARBITRATED ON A GROUP BASIS OR IN ANY ACTION IN WHICH A PARTY SEEKS TO REPRESENT OTHER INDIVIDUAL(S) IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION ("PAGA WAIVER"). PAGA CLAIMS MAY ONLY BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.

Changes. Notwithstanding the provisions of the “Modification” section above, if FetchyFox amends this “Dispute Resolution” section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) you will be notified in accordance with these Terms. You may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to support@FetchyFox.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Last Updated Date” above or in the date of FetchyFox’s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and FetchyFox in accordance with the provisions of this “Dispute Resolution” section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

Enforceability. If the “No Class Action” section of this Dispute Resolution Provision is found to be unenforceable, or if the entire Dispute Resolution Provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the entirety of the Dispute Resolution Provision will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described above will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

Right to Opt Out of Arbitration and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver: You may opt out of the foregoing arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision of this Agreement by notifying us in writing within 30 days of the date you first registered for the Services.  To opt out, you must send a written notification to FetchyFox, Inc., Attn: Legal, 100 S Murphy Ave, Sunnyvale, CA 94086 that includes (a) your account username, (b) your name, (c) your address, (d) your telephone number, (e) your email address, and (f) a clear statement indicating that you do not wish to resolve claims through arbitration and demonstrating compliance with the 30-day time limit to opt out of the above arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provisions. Alternatively or in addition, you may send this written notification to support@FetchyFox.com.

## Feedback and Reporting Misconduct

We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions (collectively “Feedback”) for improvements to the Site. You may submit feedback by emailing us at support@fetchyfox.com. You acknowledge and agree that all Feedback will be the sole and exclusive property of FetchyFox and you hereby irrevocably assign to FetchyFox and agree to irrevocably assign to FetchyFox all of your right, title, and interest in and to all Feedback, including without limitation all worldwide patent, copyright, trade secret, moral and other proprietary or intellectual property rights therein. At FetchyFox’s request and expense, you will execute documents and take such further acts as FetchyFox may reasonably request to assist FetchyFox to acquire, perfect, and maintain its intellectual property rights and other legal protections for the Feedback.

## General

The failure of FetchyFox to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of FetchyFox. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.

Certain Services features, or website and/or application areas (and your access to or use of certain aspects of the Services or content) may have different terms and conditions posted or may require you to agree with and accept additional terms and conditions. If there is a conflict between these Terms and terms and conditions posted for a specific area of the Site, Services, or Content, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your use of or access to that area of the website, application, Services, or content.
