## What Information Do We Collect? 

**Personally-Identifiable Information:** We may collect personally identifiable information when you specifically and knowingly provide it to us, for example when you register and provide personal information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, year of birth, or other information.  We may also collect location information, such as (i) depending on your app settings or device permissions, your precise or approximate location information as determined through data such as GPS, IP address and WiFi, or (ii) location information when the app is running in the foreground.

We collect transaction details related to your use of our services, including the type of services you requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. We collect information about how you interact with our services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers as discussed in section c below.

You may have the option to register using a third party service (“TPS”) or connect your account to a TPS, such as Facebook. By authorizing us to access your TPS account, you understand that we may obtain certain information from your TPS account, which may including your name, email address, birthday, work history, education history, current city, shared media, and the names, profile pictures, relationship status, and current cities of your TPS contacts. We only obtain information from your TPS account that you specifically authorize and grant us permission to obtain.

FetchyFox does not consider personal Information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not allow a third party to easily identify a specific individual. We collect and use your personally-identifiable information to operate and improve our Service, to process your transactions, to provide customer service, to perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, Service and technology, and to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences.

You may always choose not to provide personal information, but if you so choose, certain parts of the Service  may not be available to you.

**Non-Personally-Identifiable Information:**  We may collect and aggregate non-personally identifiable information, such as a website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, hardware types, geographic location, and access times and durations. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the Service content or pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the Service.

**Cookies, Pixels and Local Storage:**  We, or third parties on our behalf, may collect non-personally identifiable information via the use of cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels or local storage. Cookies are pieces of information that are transferred to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies are used to assist you in using site information and content by saving your user preferences which allows us to identify registered users and save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information. They are also used to collect aggregate information about users on an anonymous basis. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters. These electronic images assist us in determining how many users have visited certain pages or opened messages or newsletters. We do not use these single-pixel gifs to collect personal information. We also use local storage, which is an industry-standard technology which allows a website or application to store information locally on your computer or mobile device which allows us to customize your experience and the content you may see.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies or to request your permission each time a service attempts to set a cookie. Please be aware that the Service is optimally designed to operate with cookies enabled; if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of the Service that depend on cookies.

## What Do We Do With The Information That We Collect?

Except as disclosed in this privacy policy, we do not share your personal information with any outside parties.

We will use the personally identifiable information directly provided by you solely for the purpose for which you have provided it, whether it be to register, use the Service, communicate with others, request information, etc.  We may share this information with service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as processing information requests, displaying stored data you access, to assist us in marketing, to conduct audits, etc. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to provide the service they provide, will be required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, and will be prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

We may also use the information you provide to contact you for reasons related to your submitted content, use of the Service, in reply to a communication to us, or otherwise as you have authorized. We may send you email or text messages or call your mobile number regarding the Service, existing or prospective products and services, or to obtain information to better understand our users.  You can opt out of such non-transactional communications at any time.

We may also use information you provide to better serve you, and, if you have given your consent for us to do so, to send you email or text messages concerning offers from our partners and other third parties that we think may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive marketing emails, you may adjust your “Personal Information Preferences” as described below or follow the “unsubscribe” or “STOP” instructions included within each communication.

We or our third-party partners will use non-personally-identifiable information to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from our users to administer our content in order to improve the Service. We may also perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in our online products and services for product development purposes.

*Disclosure:*  As a general rule, we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except under one of the following circumstances: we have your permission; we determine in good faith that it is legally required to be revealed by any relevant statute, regulation, ordinance, rule, administrative or court order, decree, or subpoena; information revealed during the course of FetchyFox’s enforcement of the policies and procedures of the Service, its application, and/or website; information that we determine must be disclosed to correct what we believe to be false or misleading information or to address activities that we believe to be manipulative, deceptive or otherwise a violation of law; where you are otherwise notified at the time we collect the data; where we need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; when such disclosure is made subject to confidentiality restrictions in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by FetchyFox. FetchyFox may share the non-personally identifiable information that FetchyFox gathers, in aggregate form only, with advertisers and other partners.

## Security and Encryption

We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information.  No method of transmission over the internet, mobile technology, or method of electronic storage, is completely secure. Therefore, while we endeavor to maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information that we collect online, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. Our Service has security measures in place designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption that encodes information for such transmissions. We also encrypt data stored in our servers (“at-rest”) using AES-256 “at-rest” . All Service information is maintained on secure servers. Access to stored data is protected by multi-layered security controls including firewalls, role-based access controls and passwords. You are responsible to keep your password secure.

## Children's Policy

The Terms of Service clearly provide that Users must be (i) 18 or older, or (ii) 13 and older if either (a) an emancipated minor, or (b) he/she possess legal parental or guardian consent. FetchyFox does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under 13.  In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a user under the age of 13, we will attempt to identify and delete that information from our database.

## International Usage

The Service is owned by FetchyFox and may be accessed in the United States and abroad. For data protection purposes, FetchyFox is the controller and, unless otherwise noted, is also the processor of data. Information collected may be retained, and may be stored, processed, accessed, and used in jurisdictions whose privacy laws may be different and less protective than those of your home jurisdiction.  If you are located outside of the United States, please note that the information you provide to us may be transferred to the United States. By using the Service, application and/or website, you consent to such transfer.

## Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to change the terms of this privacy policy at any time. When we make changes, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of the policy.
